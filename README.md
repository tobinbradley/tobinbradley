## Hi, I'm Tobin 👋

I’m a writer, designer, developer and speaker. I work for Mecklenburg County GIS in North Carolina USA, where I do a bit of everything, from sysadmin and database admin to software design and development to strategic planning and architecture. My most popular Github projects are [Dirt](https://github.com/tobinbradley/dirt-simple-postgis-http-api), a Node.js API for interacting with PostgreSQL/PostGIS, and [GeoPortal](https://github.com/tobinbradley/Mecklenburg-County-GeoPortal), an easy to use local government mapping and data portal.

If you want to see what I'm up to, check out my blog [Fuzzy Tolerance](http://fuzzytolerance.info) or follow me on Twitter [@fuzzytolerance](twitter.com/fuzzytolerance). I also put tutorial videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnWMEbT0UVt2ne9sMwQ3TAg).
